**Name:** Tantibus

**Genre:** 2D side scrolling platform game

**Description:**

The Tantibus is a 2-dimensional (2D) side scrolling platform game about the main characterâ€™s dreams. Whenever the character goes to sleep, he has nightmares. In order to end his bad dreaming experience, the main character must fight his inner dark side and figure out what is causing the nightmares.
The plot revolves around the main character and his dreaming experience. Each dream is represented by a unique level. The hero meets various demons that describe a level. In general there will be seven basic levels that depict seven deadly sins: lust, greed, gluttony, envy, anger, pride, and sloth. In order to pass a level, the main character must defeat enemies that will try to steer the main character from the virtuous path (figuratively). In the end when the hero surpasses all of the sins, he will become a truly virtuous person and the nightmares will end.
